# This is me, Frederic von Abercron

## Early Days
My name is *Frederic von Abercron*, I am 24 years old and currently enrolled as a student at **London Business School in the United Kingdom**.
I was born in Luebeck, a mid-sized city in the German north, close to the coasts of the Baltic sea in 1996. Together with my three brothers, a twin and two older ones, I spent my first four years on my family's farm - a happy and sheltered childhood, far away from the hectic and excitement of any larger city. It was in the year of 2001 though, that my dad decided to sell parts of our land to a German conglomerate and to move to the South. Munich in Bavaria to be precise.

## Youth
And here I grew up. After finishing elementary school, I attended the local high school - at first separately from my twin brother, later in joint classes. The highlight of my school days was a 4 month stay abroad in **Australia** at the Gold Coast in the 10th grade. The impressions I gathered here, paired with the independence and distance to my parents fascinated me very deeply and so after my return I decided to concentrate more on my future plans. University and career were suddenly things that I put emphasis on. So very soon I sympathized with the idea of studying abroad. 
Switzerland - with its role as a neutral authority in the midst of the chaotic European Union - was very appealing to me, that's why I decided to apply for a place at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/). And indeed, I passed the entrance test and started my education in September 2014.

## University and Professional Development
Those were great years. Extensive experiences, friends for life and semesters abroad in **Bangkok** and **Buenos Aires** - the university with its extensive opportunities helped me to develop myself. And not only that, I suddenly knew where I wanted to go. After various internships in venture capital, investment banking and private equity,  I was sure I wanted to work in the world of finance. My positions included, among others:

1) Global Venture Development Intern at Rocket Internet in Berlin
2) Founder of my own company, "Die Uhrensammler", a re-commerce platform for luxury watches in Munich
3) Venture Capital Intern at Holtzbrinck Ventures in Munich\
4) Priavte Equity Intern at Gilde Buyout Partners in Zurich, and lastly
5) Investment Banking Intern at Lazard in Frankfurt.

In order to give my career the right impetus, build the necessary network and find the best possible job opportunities, I now decided to become part of [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/new-homepage-test?sc_camp=3B9F97886AD24D7B8BB7A0002BAB507C&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwOz6BRCgARIsAKEG4FWF6aVlpxIBQKJoELiSRf15HuljMWIESXX646GVWvg6suf9_5aSUKwaAjd6EALw_wcB&utm_expid=.HSmVWBABRQySTtX9SBm7NA.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F).

## Hobbies and Interests
A question always hard to answer, especially in a professional environment. While as a small child I was neither good at a sport nor particularly interested in getting better, this changed abruptly with increasing age. After several years in the local soccer and field hockey club, I started playing tennis at the age of 9 - a sport to which I have stayed loyal to this day. And even though my skill level probably reached its peak at the age of 16 or 17, it is still a welcome amusement in the fresh air today. It's also an activity that's ideal to share with friends. Next to tennis, I have been working hard on my golf handicap over the past years and can proudly claim to have reached 16. However, it is questionable whether I will find the time and leisure to do so in the future. In the winter, I am a passionate skier on the slopes of the Austrian Alps and, at least most of the time, I don't shy away from taking risks here (which has been my downfall the past season though).

I am also an enthusiastic hunter and fisherman and like to travel. Recently, my passion brought me to exotic regions like South America, Southeast Asia or India. Besides the food, it is the people, the sounds and smells that fascinate me the most. Traveling means freedom, independence and excitement and we're lucky enough to live in times where coming from one place to another is as easy as never before.

Lastly, music plays a crucial role in my life. And as I know this is a sensitive topic for many people, that don't share my love for Barry White, Cock Robin or Eric Clapton, why don't you make up your own mind and listen to my very personal legacy called [Freds Megamix](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6z2ywo3IRgtn2akvftUQpO?si=pJUMm1NzR_CZ-co0071TaA).
