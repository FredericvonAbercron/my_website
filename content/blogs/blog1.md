# My biography - Frederic von Abercron\

## Early Days
My name is *Frederic von Abercron*, I am 24 years old and currently enrolled as a student at **London Business School in the United Kingdom**.
I was born in Luebeck, a mid-sized city in the German north, close to the coasts of the Baltic sea in 1996. Together with my three brothers, a twin and two older ones, I spent my first four years on my family's farm - a happy and sheltered childhood, far away from the hectic and excitement of any larger city. It was in the year of 2001 though, that my dad decided to sell parts of our land to a German conglomerate and to move to the South. Munich in Bavaria to be precise.\

## Youth
And here I grew up. After finishing elementary school, I attended the local high school - at first separately from my twin brother, later in joint classes. The highlight of my school days was a 4 month stay abroad in **Australia** at the Gold Coast in the 10th grade. The impressions I gathered here, paired with the independence and distance to my parents fascinated me very deeply and so after my return I decided to concentrate more on my future plans. University and career were suddenly things that I put emphasis on. So very soon I sympathized with the idea of studying abroad. 
Switzerland - with its role as a neutral authority in the midst of the chaotic European Union - was very appealing to me, that's why I decided to apply for a place at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/). And indeed, I passed the entrance test and started my education in September 2014.\

## University and Professional Development
Those were great years. Extensive experiences, friends for life and semesters abroad in **Bangkok** and **Buenos Aires** - the university with its extensive opportunities helped me to develop myself. And not only that, I suddenly knew where I wanted to go. After various internships in venture capital, investment banking and private equity,  I was sure I wanted to work in the world of finance. My positions included, among others:\

1) Global Venture Development Intern at Rocket Internet in Berlin\
2) Founder of my own company, "Die Uhrensammler", a re-commerce platform for luxury watches in Munich\
3) Venture Capital Intern at Holtzbrinck Ventures in Munich\
4) Priavte Equity Intern at Gilde Buyout Partners in Zurich, and lastly\
5) Investment Banking Intern at Lazard in Frankfurt.\

In order to give my career the right impetus, build the necessary network and find the best possible job opportunities, I now decided to become part of [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/new-homepage-test?sc_camp=3B9F97886AD24D7B8BB7A0002BAB507C&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwOz6BRCgARIsAKEG4FWF6aVlpxIBQKJoELiSRf15HuljMWIESXX646GVWvg6suf9_5aSUKwaAjd6EALw_wcB&utm_expid=.HSmVWBABRQySTtX9SBm7NA.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F).
